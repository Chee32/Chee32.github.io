				<h2>About this Site</h2>
				<p>
					The main reason I built this site was to have both a place to show potential hires my skills but also to have a way to show my projects on GitHub other than my GitHub page.  I built it using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I felt I needed a project that went back to basics.  This will hopefully help build my confidence and knowledge in web development.
